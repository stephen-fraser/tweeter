# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page AJAX-based Twitter clone that uses jQuery, HTML 5 and CSS3 to help a poor bootcamp student like myself get comfortable with their front-end skills.

## Dependencies

- Body-parser
- Chance
- Express
- MD5

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
2. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
3. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser and enjoy.
4. The twitter clone utilizes media query functionality to provide a desktop view and mobile based on the client pixel view width.
5. Type a tweet, click submit, and see it instantly posted below.
6. Test validation error messages by attempting to post a blank tweet or a tweet exceeding 140 characters.

I hope you enjoy my second project.
